# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
This project intends to create a simple platform for comparing game playing algorithms. The essential sub-routines for game play are provided and the game itself is the very simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game. While the game is not ideal since it does not represent other kinds of games (winnable, non-winnable etc.), this seeems a good place to start.
